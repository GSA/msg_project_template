# Design Notes

The design is blocked by month with each veteran assigned to receive an email using formal language, an email using informal language, and no email (the control group). Assignment was in equal numbers within month.

The primary outcome is number of enrollments, especially within 30 days.

And the team pre-registered a subgroup analysis of Combat Veterans as well.
