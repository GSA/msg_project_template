# Project Template

This is the bare bones template for our projects. This is a work in progress. Comments welcome.

To use it
 1. Make a new empty project repository with appropriate name on GitHub.  Use the form `NNNN-ABC-MyProjectDescription` (where `NNNN` is the four-digit project code, `ABC` is the agency abbreviation, and `MyProjectDescription` is a very short project description in Pascal case).
 2. Clone the new project repo to your local machine
 3. Clone **this** template repository to your local machine
 4. Copy everything from this template repository (except the `.git` directory) to the directory containing the new blank project repository. For example, you can use the following command at the unix/Mac/bash/zsh shell command line `rsync -auvzr --exclude='.git/' * ../mynewproject` if you are already in the `ProjectTemplate` directory.
 5. From within the new project repository add, commit, and push everything back to GitHub (or edit stuff first and then add, commit, and push).
 6. Change names of files:
    1. Change name of the `.Rproj` file.
    2. Make other changes.
 7. Now delete all of the text in this Project Template section. The `README.md` should begin with the following.


# NAME OF PROJECT

This is the GitHub repository for THE PROJECT.
